# SEproject

First of all, execute the first file (1-Create Schema Admin) on Oracle SQL developer to create the admin user of the database. Then, login as admin_user as defined in the script. Finally, execute the two other files (2-Create Tables Automations Users & 3-Load Tables) to create tables, triggers, functions/procedures, other users and load the tables.

Once you cloned the project, type "npm start" in your cmd. It will launch the backend server (on http://localhost:3000) and the frontend (on http://localhost:4200).
You can explore the tables information from the database via the frontpage.

If issue with database, verify you already have the Oracle SQL database configured and the right login host/user/password defined in your database.
