# SEproject

First of all, execute the first file (1-Create Schema Admin) on Oracle SQL developer to create the admin user of the database. Then, login as admin_user as defined in the script. Finally, execute the two other files (2-Create Tables Automations Users & 3-Load Tables) to create tables, triggers, functions/procedures, other users and load the tables.

Once you cloned the project, type "npm start" in your cmd. It will launch the backend server and the frontend.
You can explore the tables information from the database via the frontpage (on http://localhost:4200).

If you have issue with the database, verify you already have the Oracle SQL database configured and the right login host/user/password as defined in your database.
